# Local Development
This document describes how to setup the system locally for development purposes.

---

### 0. Prerequisite tools
- Docker - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Kotlin 1.8.10^ - [Install Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html)
- Java 17^ - [Install Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- Postgres - [Install Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or use the provided docker-compose file
- Kafka and Zookeeper - [Install Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) or use the provided docker-compose file
- Gradle 8.0^ - [Install Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
- IntelliJ IDEA - [Install IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) preferably but not mandatory

### 1. Setting up Kafka's cluster
It's mandatory to have a running Kafka cluster in order to run the system. The easiest way to do so is by using this custom script which provides a docker-compose file that can be used to spin up a Kafka cluster with all the needed services. [Kafka Cluster](../local/kafka/README.md)

> Note: This script works only on Arm64 based machines ATM, if you're using a different architecture, you can use omit the `ghcr.io/arm64-compat/` prefix from the image names in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

<br>

### 2. Setting up the database
The system uses a Postgres database to store its data. The easiest way to set it up is by using the provided docker-compose file. [Postgres](./local/database/postgres.yaml) 

```bash
docker-compose -f ./local/database/postgres.yaml up -d
```

<br>

### 3. Generating Kafka's AVRO schemas
The system uses Kafka's AVRO schemas to serialize and deserialize the messages that are being sent and received. The schemas are located in the `infrastrcture/kafka/model/src/main/resources/avro-schema` directory of each service. In order to generate the Java client from the schemas, you can use the provided gradle task `generateAvro`. The following command will generate the Java classes for all the schemas in the mentioned directory directory.

```bash
./gradlew generateAvro
```

<br>

### 4. Building and Running from source
For building the services from source, you can use the provided gradle wrapper in the root directory. The following command will build all the services and their dependencies.

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```
then you can run the services using the following command in the respective service's `main` directory:
```bash
./gradlew :<service-name>:bootRun
# or
./gradlew bootRun
```

or you can run the services using IntelliJ's run configurations.

### 5. Building from K8s
